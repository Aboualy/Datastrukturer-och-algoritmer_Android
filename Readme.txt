It is an old school project. 
At the start of you need to enter a username:

The game has a snake, an apple and a toxic mushroom. 
The snake moves freely and a double-clicking on the board makes the snake to move towards the click.
If the snake eats an apple, its tail grows and the player gets a point, whereas if it eats a toxic mushroom, it dies.
At the end of the game, a list of the names and scores will show up.

Enjoy the game :)
